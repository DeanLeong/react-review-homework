# React Review Homework

This weekend's assignment is to reflect on and review the first week of the unit. First, take a minute and assess where you're at with React. Do you feel comfortable with the basic fundamentals? Or do you feel like you could apply your knowledge to another activity?

It may be useful to check out Bloom's Taxonomy to self-reflect and assess.

Here are some options for what you could do today.

## If you're uncomfortable with the fundamentals

* Look back through the lessons from the week and re-do some of the exercises. Also, look at the additional resources linked in each lesson.
* Build out a new react app that interests you.
* Write [sketch notes](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/11/how-to-get-started-with-sketchnotes/) about our React material. Revisit old lessons to do this.

## If you are looking for a challenge

* Teach yourself something new within React and then build something with your new skill. Some great options would be [Redux](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-nyc-supernovas/react-redux), [React Native](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-lessons/react-native-intro), [GraphQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoaZnAB9_yk), or [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).

* Write a blog post on something you learned this unit. Hint: Storybook or styling in React would be a ðŸ”¥ topic. Show the world your knowledge -- it'll be awesome for your career. You could also make a YouTube video teaching a concept.

* Contribute to open source. There are so many libraries out there looking for contributors, and having open source contributions on your portfolio/resume is a huge leg up. Check the `issues` tab of any React project.

## Deliverables

In an issue in this repository, write a paragraph on how you're feeling about React. Also, write another paragraph about what you tackled over the weekend. Send us a link to any labs/blog posts you wrote! We can't wait to see them!
